## Description
"Tile Matcher" is a captivating puzzle game where players match and eliminate tiles of the same design or colour. Clear the board by strategically selecting and removing matching pairs, aiming for high scores and challenging yourself to create chain reactions. It's a fast-paced and addictive game that tests your pattern recognition skills while providing hours of enjoyable gameplay.

I developed this game while enrolled in the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and implement the game.

I chose to develop a tile matching game because of its addictive and engaging nature.

Tile matching games have a fascinating history that can be traced back to the earliest days of electronic gaming. The genre gained significant popularity in the 1980s with the introduction of games like "Tetris" and "Columns." These classic titles captured the attention of players worldwide, showcasing the addictive nature of arranging and eliminating tiles. As technology advanced, tile matching games continued to evolve, embracing different themes and variations. From the emergence of "Bejewelled" in the early 2000s to the widespread success of mobile games like "Candy Crush Saga," tile matching games have become a staple in the gaming industry, captivating players of all ages with their engaging gameplay mechanics and challenging puzzles.

## High Concept
Immerse yourself in the addictive world of tile matching, where quick thinking, strategic moves, and pattern recognition collide. Clear the board by matching and eliminating tiles, creating captivating chain reactions and aiming for the highest scores.

## Deployment
The game is deployed on GitHub pages, and you can play the game here: https://github.com/HaruThePotato/Tiler

## How To Play
The objective is to find and match pairs of identical tiles on the game board. Just click or select one tile, then click or select another adjacent tile that matches. When a match is made, the tiles will disappear, and a new batch of tiles will appear. Continue making as many matches as you can in order to reach your goal.
