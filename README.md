## Description
"Tile Matcher" is a captivating puzzle game where players match and eliminate tiles of the same design or colour. Clear the board by strategically selecting and removing matching pairs, aiming for high scores and challenging yourself to create chain reactions. It's a fast-paced and addictive game that tests your pattern recognition skills while providing hours of enjoyable gameplay.

I developed this game while enrolled in the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and implement the game.

I chose to develop a tile matching game because of its addictive and engaging nature.

Tile matching games have a fascinating history that can be traced back to the earliest days of electronic gaming. The genre gained significant popularity in the 1980s with the introduction of games like "Tetris" and "Columns." These classic titles captured the attention of players worldwide, showcasing the addictive nature of arranging and eliminating tiles. As technology advanced, tile matching games continued to evolve, embracing different themes and variations. From the emergence of "Bejewelled" in the early 2000s to the widespread success of mobile games like "Candy Crush Saga," tile matching games have become a staple in the gaming industry, captivating players of all ages with their engaging gameplay mechanics and challenging puzzles.

## High Concept
Immerse yourself in the addictive world of tile matching, where quick thinking, strategic moves, and pattern recognition collide. Clear the board by matching and eliminating tiles, creating captivating chain reactions and aiming for the highest scores.

## Deployment
The game is deployed on GitHub pages, and you can play the game here: https://github.com/HaruThePotato/Tiler

## How To Play
The objective is to find and match pairs of identical tiles on the game board. Just click or select one tile, then click or select another adjacent tile that matches. When a match is made, the tiles will disappear, and a new batch of tiles will appear. Continue making as many matches as you can in order to reach your goal.

## Development Stage
- Generating the Board with adjustable columns and rows [Timeline: 5 days]
- Create the Game Logic [Timeline: 2 weeks]
- Create User Interface [Timeline: 3 days]
- Create point system [Timeline: 1 weeks]
- Style the Game [Timeline: 3 days]

## Key Learnings
1. Gained a solid understanding of core programming concepts such as variables, loops, conditional statements, and functions.

2. Learned to utilize data structures like arrays or grids to represent the game board and implemented algorithms for tile matching, movement, and other game mechanics.

3. I learned how to determine if a tile that the user has chosen matches any patterns within the grid after it is moved to either one of the four directions available by checking all the tiles on the board whenever a change occurs, finding the tiles with 2 or more identical pairings next to them, adding them all into an array and eliminating the identical ones.

4. I learned how to swap tiles around by fiddling around between the user’s selection, updating the array and rendering it’s content on a web browser.

## Favourite Functions
Among the various functions within this tile matching game, I particularly found the pattern checking function, tile manipulation function, and grid creation function to be the most enjoyable to develop.


## Future Developments / Improvements
if there were any future developments, these would be the future improvements I would implement:

- Apply a better styling and theme to the entire game so that users who care deeply about graphics would also enjoy the game
- Recreate the game with shorter, cleaner, and more organized codes independently.
- Create a level system to the tile matching game so that it would progressively get harder.
- Adding bombs and other unique power ups that the users can use.
- Create an instruction page.

## Summary
I embraced the challenge of developing a tile matching game because I found it enjoyable and recognized its heavy reliance on logical thinking and coding skills. I believed that it would provide an excellent opportunity to strengthen my foundation in programming.

While creating this game, I encountered numerous instances where I had to devise solutions to overcome various challenges and implement essential features.
