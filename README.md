## Description
"Tile Matcher" is a captivating puzzle game where players match and eliminate tiles of the same design or colour. Clear the board by strategically selecting and removing matching pairs, aiming for high scores and challenging yourself to create chain reactions. It's a fast-paced and addictive game that tests your pattern recognition skills while providing hours of enjoyable gameplay.

Tile matching games have a fascinating history that can be traced back to the earliest days of electronic gaming. The genre gained significant popularity in the 1980s with the introduction of games like "Tetris" and "Columns." These classic titles captured the attention of players worldwide, showcasing the addictive nature of arranging and eliminating tiles. As technology advanced, tile matching games continued to evolve, embracing different themes and variations. From the emergence of "Bejewelled" in the early 2000s to the widespread success of mobile games like "Candy Crush Saga," tile matching games have become a staple in the gaming industry, captivating players of all ages with their engaging gameplay mechanics and challenging puzzles.

During my enrollment in the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly, I successfully developed this game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies were utilized to design and implement the game, showcasing the skills acquired during the course.

I decided to develop a tile matching game due to its captivating and addictive nature. The inherent appeal of the gameplay motivated me to choose this particular genre for development.

## High Concept
Immerse yourself in the addictive world of tile matching, where quick thinking, strategic moves, and pattern recognition collide. Clear the board by matching and eliminating tiles, creating captivating chain reactions and aiming for the highest scores.

## Deployment
The game is deployed on GitHub pages, and you can play the game here: https://github.com/HaruThePotato/Tiler

## How To Play
The objective is to find and match pairs of identical tiles on the game board. Just click or select one tile, then click or select another adjacent tile that matches. When a match is made, the tiles will disappear, and a new batch of tiles will appear. Continue making as many matches as you can in order to reach your goal.

## Development Stage
- Generating the Board with adjustable columns and rows [Timeline: 5 days]
- Create the Game Logic [Timeline: 2 weeks]
- Create User Interface [Timeline: 3 days]
- Create point system [Timeline: 1 weeks]
- Style the Game [Timeline: 3 days]

## Key Learnings
1. Gained a solid understanding of core programming concepts such as variables, loops, conditional statements, and functions.

2. Learned to utilize data structures like arrays or grids to represent the game board and implemented algorithms for tile matching, movement, and other game mechanics.

3. Throughout the development process, I acquired the skill of identifying matching patterns within the grid. I achieved this by thoroughly examining all the tiles on the board whenever a change occurred, detecting tiles with multiple identical pairings adjacent to them, and subsequently adding them to an array. By eliminating the duplicate entries, I successfully determined if the user's selected tile matched any existing patterns within the grid.

4. Another valuable lesson I learned was how to manipulate tiles by implementing a swapping mechanism. I honed this skill through experimentation and by carefully managing the user's selection. This involved updating the corresponding array elements and dynamically rendering the updated content on a web browser.

## Favourite Functions
Among the various functions within this tile matching game, I particularly found the pattern checking function, tile manipulation function, and grid creation function to be the most enjoyable to develop.

## Future Developments / Improvements
if there were any future developments, these would be the future improvements I would implement:

- Apply a better styling and theme to the entire game so that users who care deeply about graphics would also enjoy the game
- Recreate the game with shorter, cleaner, and more organized codes independently.
- Create a level system to the tile matching game so that it would progressively get harder.
- Adding bombs and other unique power ups that the users can use.
- Create an instruction page.

## Summary
I embraced the challenge of developing a tile matching game because I found it enjoyable and recognized its heavy reliance on logical thinking and coding skills. I believed that it would provide an excellent opportunity to strengthen my foundation in programming.

While creating this game, I encountered numerous instances where I had to devise solutions to overcome various challenges and implement essential features.
